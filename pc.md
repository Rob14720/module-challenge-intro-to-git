## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
 Git is a software where coders work using an actual command line. It's an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.
 It is capable of actually modifying or adding files to the computer.
 Using its various functions you can write, save, and share code with your teammates,
or save it for your own personal projects by uploading it to GitHub by using push.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
 Git is the software here the coding actuall happens. GitHub is the domain where it's accessible and is stored in
a cloud.

3. Why do we create a branch?
  We create branches so that we place our work in a seperate environment where it can then be reviewed by seniors
without the worry of it effecting the core files right away (which would be called the main branch). The employer
or the worker themself would then have it to look at and troubleshoot for bugs before finally merging it.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
  
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
